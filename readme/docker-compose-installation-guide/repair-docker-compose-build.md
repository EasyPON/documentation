# Repair Docker compose build

<pre class="language-bash"><code class="lang-bash"><strong>bash &#x3C;(curl https://cabinet.easypon.in/install_ep.sh) docker-repair
</strong></code></pre>

Repair works by restoring the last backup of the EasyPON web application. It can be the rollback to the previous stable version of EasyPON.
