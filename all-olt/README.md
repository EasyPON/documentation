# OLT workspace

## &#x20;All OLT

In this section, you can connect new OLTs and manage existing OLTs in the EasyPON application.

### Quick Actions Bar

With the help of the Quick Actions Bar, you can view documentation of this section, view downloaded reports that were generated by the "Export to XLSX"  option, manage ONu migrations by accessing the [Migrations](<../Port Migration.md>) sections, and add new OLT to the EasyPON application.

### Filter OLT

You can filter the OLT base by the following filter parameters:

* [**OLT type**](../easypon-information/supported-olts.md) **- the type of OLT.**
* **Name - the name of OLT in the EasyPON system.**
* **Hostname**
* **Status**
* **Online Status**
* **Autosave**
* **ONU min count**
* **ONU max count**
* **Shel**

You can also use the Add saved search record and always have fast access for applying frequent search templates. You can always delete saved searches to clear the applied filter with the corresponding options.

### OLT list page

You can access basic information about the OLTs in the general sector. To explore further about any of them, you can navigate to the [OLT detailed info](./#olt-detailed-information) page by clicking on the arrow in the "View" column.
