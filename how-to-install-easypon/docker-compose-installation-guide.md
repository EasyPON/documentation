# üê≥ Docker compose installation guide

## Automatic Docker compose installation

You can **install** EasyPON with Docker Compose just by executing the bash script with the `docker-install` parameter in Terminal.

```bash
apt update && apt install curl -y
bash <(curl https://cabinet.easypon.in/install_ep.sh) docker-install
```

To **upgrade** EasyPON build you can run

<pre class="language-bash"><code class="lang-bash"><strong>bash &#x3C;(curl https://cabinet.easypon.in/install_ep.sh) docker-upgrade
</strong></code></pre>

To **repair** the EasyPON build run

<pre class="language-bash"><code class="lang-bash"><strong>bash &#x3C;(curl https://cabinet.easypon.in/install_ep.sh) docker-repair
</strong></code></pre>

## Manual Docker compose installation

If you need to execute a manual Docker compose installation process you can follow the instructions.

You need to have Docker Engine and Docker Compose on your machine. You can either:

* Install [Docker Engine](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) as standalone binaries or
* Install [Docker Desktop](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/) which includes both Docker Engine and Docker Compose
* Installation instructions specific for [Docker Engine](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/debian/) on Debian

You don't need to install Python or Redis, as Docker images provide both.

1. Download the archive from your [EasyPON personal cabinet account](https://cabinet.easypon.in/) license, unpack the archive, and go to the unpacked directory by using the commands.

```bash
tar -xvf easypon.tar 
cd easypon
```

2. Create env files

```bash
touch .env_docker
touch .env
```

2. Build images with the following command:

```bash
docker compose build
```

3. Generate .env\_docker

```bash
docker run --rm easypon-backend init > .env_docker 
```

4. Start your project

```bash
docker compose up -d 
```

5. To create an admin user, utilize the login and password from the environment variables specified in the `.env_docker` file:

```bash
docker compose exec -ti backend_main bash compose/backend-entry-point.sh create_user
```

## Accessing EasyPON

To access EasyPon, open your browser and navigate to your server's domain name or IP address. You will be prompted to log in with your credentials, which you received in the terminal during installation, or which can be found in `/root/.tmp_ep_users`.
