# Reports

You have the flexibility to download any information from the table, regardless of whether it has been filtered or not. Generating a comprehensive report based on your selection may require some time for the system to process. However, you will receive a notification once the report is ready, and the action button will become active, enabling you to proceed with the download.

The Reports section can be located mostly in every section of EasyPON. To get to the section click the **All Downloads** button in the Quick Actions Bar.
