# Actions for ONU

Action is a feature, that helps you to apply custom code to the ONU, that otherwise you have to perform manually step by step. This simplifies any interaction with ONU and helps you to automate your daily routine. This could include tasks like provisioning, configuring, or troubleshooting the ONU.

The main difference between Preset and Action is that Ppreset is used for registering new ONUs instead of creating custom actions with registered ONUs in the EasyPON web application.\
\
You may access the Action submenu by clicking on **Settings > Action** in the Main Menu.

To add a new Action you just have to tap on the button **Add Action**. After that, you can set the Action Name, Code, Description, and ONU types on the Action form. You can use the [Macros list](macros.md) for your convenience to fill the required ONU parameters in the code field by clicking on the macros.
