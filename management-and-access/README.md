# Access & Management

## Log in

Hi there! My name is Docs and today I will tell you more about our PON management system.&#x20;

The first step is to [log in](login-page.md) to the system. To do this, go to your server address and use the credentials that were provided to you in the Terminal after successfully installing EasyPON on your server.

After that, you can check out your account and get info about the license by clicking on the [Profile](./) main menu section.

## Users

You can add new users to your EasyPON system, [configure their access](users.md#all-permissions), or use [default permission Groups](group-access.md#standard-permission-groups) to assign system permissions in one click.

## Settings

This block contains a [Periodic task page](../access-and-management/periodic-tasks.md) and a [Group permissions configuration page](group-access.md).

Periodic task configuration allows you to manage requests for information from your OLTs to optimize the capacity of requests and not overload them by asking for something frequently.&#x20;

Group permissions are made for you to easily give access to a special part of the system to a group of people. You can configure any step from here and ensure your employees have all the required information for work.

You can also find the [Preset list](../configuration-features/presets.md) for ONU registration, [actions](../configuration-features/custom-action.md) for ONU, and [integration](./#integration) sections.

## Integration

The [Integration](integration.md) section of the EasyPON web application empowers users to seamlessly connect various external components to enhance their experience with EasyPON. Integrate Google services, UserSide integration, and create public API keys for interfacing with external EasyPON API.
