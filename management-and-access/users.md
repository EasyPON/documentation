## Editing a user

The edit form allows you to change details of the user, such as their password and permissions, categorized by either group or personal preferences.

You can assign a group to a user and provide them with special permissions by granting access in the "special permissions" sector. These permissions will take precedence over the permissions assigned to their group, but assigned already group permissions will not be excluded.
