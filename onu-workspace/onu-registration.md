# ONU registration

You can register an ONU on the OLT in the EasyPON system using the Unregistered ONU modal window, which is called up from the main menu by pressing the X New ONU button, where X is the number of currently unregistered ONUs in the EasyPON system.

## Unregistered ONU

The Unregistered ONU modal window displays the complete list of ONUs that can be registered to the OLT using the existing configuration that was added in [Preset](https://app.archbee.com/docs/lY30u8w4Ej45vCHqsmBtW/9wfmoGkq8ifJUp7u\_bjWb). It is also possible to use the Refresh button to manually update unregistered ONUs. In normal mode, the list of unregistered ONUs in the EasyPON system is periodically updated.
