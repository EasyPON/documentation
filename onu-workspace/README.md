# ONU workspace

You have the [Find ONU](onu-search.md) tool in the main menu section where you can find ONU by MAC address or serial number or even the MAC address of the client's device on the OLT or Switch.

To [register an ONU](onu-registration.md), locate a new ONU in the Unregistered ONU modal window by pressing the New ONU button. If the configuration has already been added to the [Preset list](../configuration-features/presets.md), you can easily apply it in this step.

You can get monitoring information on the [detailed ONU page](onu.md) by clicking on any View button in the table item on the [All ONU page](all-onu.md). \
