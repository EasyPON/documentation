It is possible to migrate a separate port with all registered ONU cards on OLT to a different OLT port with just a few actions:

1.  Choose a port for migration in the Ports section on a specific OLT page and click action Migration. A migration process will be planned for the port.

2.  You will be redirected to the Migration page.

3.  Reconnect the chosen OLT port to the incoming migration port and press "Finish Migration" to finish the migration process. All migrated ONU cards will be shown up in the History list.

If the migration process has been planned earlier on the specific port, the action Migration icon will be changed to the link for locating planned migration.
